Hello! I am a Python and C developer with over 2 years of experience, passionate about crafting innovative software solutions. I am currently actively working on a project called "Aegis."

Aegis Project Overview
"Aegis" is a dynamic and multithreaded program designed to establish remote connections with sensors. Leveraging my expertise in Python and C, I am developing this project to provide a seamless and efficient solution for sensor connectivity.

Key Features
Flask-based GUI: Aegis utilizes Flask, a powerful web framework, to deliver an intuitive and user-friendly graphical interface. I am hoping to ensure a smooth and enjoyable experience for users.

Prebuilt Functionality: Users will have the flexibility to choose from a variety of prebuilt functions, allowing them to customize and optimize sensor operations to suit their specific needs.

SDR and Commercial Hardware Integration: Aegis harnesses the power of Software-Defined Radios (SDRs) and readily available commercial off-the-shelf hardware to capture RF data. This data is then securely transmitted back to the server for further analysis and processing.

GPS Data Integration: By seamlessly incorporating GPS data, Aegis enriches the sensor information with accurate location tracking, enhancing the overall functionality and value of the system.

Next Steps
As I continue to refine the Aegis project, my focus is on expanding its capabilities and enhancing user experience. One of the exciting upcoming features is the development of a server-side graphical user interface (GUI) that will visually represent each sensor on a map, providing users with a comprehensive overview of their network.

I am committed to delivering a reliable and efficient solution through continuous development and innovation.
